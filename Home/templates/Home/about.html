           About Us!!
        </h2>
        <p>IL Rifugio is an endeavour of us students to provide people with mental health issues a safe space to talk about their troubles and issues. In a career oriented society, where every personâ€™s worth is decided by how much he/she can contribute to the advancement and success of their careers, while keeping their health at stake, this is our effort to provide the people with a platform where they can ask for help and hence take a turn towards a better, happier and healthier life.
            In IL Rifugio, we aim to create a safe space where people can be free to talk about their mental health concerns and issues without the fear of being isolated or judged. We aim to be a platform that aims to help people who need help and also educate other people about the various obstacles that these people face.
            Here we connect you to professional doctors and therapists who have a lot of experience in helping people with mental health issues. We also connect you to other people who have successfully handled situations which some people might not know how to deal with.</p>
